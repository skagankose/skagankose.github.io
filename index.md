# Introduction

Social media usage is significantly increased in recent years. According to [Smart Insights](http://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/), 482 million people joined social networks since the last year. There is an enormous amount of data created by these individuals. And, this data provides an unique opportunity to analyze societies.

Within the field of Natural Language Processing, there are highly effective techniques to extract meaningful informations from piles of data. There are terrific sources to learn more about NLP.

I want to emphasize that deep learning has become a crucial part of NLP studies, especially after the paper [Natural Language Processing (almost) from Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0398). Consequently, deep learning is (almost) a pre-requisite for studying NLP. Here are some of the outstanding deep learning courses.

After an extensive introduction, I now, proceed to details of my research.

My aim in this research is to analyze the Twitter network of Istanbul Sehir Univesity using various NLP methods. First, I constructed the Sehir Tweeter Network (STN) and then, proceed to NLP analysis. The methods I utilized through the analysis are as follows (in order).

* Determine what are the most popular topics within STN using **latent dirichlet allocation**
* Construct a label prediction model to categorize tweets using **fasttext** and **basic neural networks**
* Test the coherency (performance) of our prediction model using **LSTM networks**
* Assign a label to each tweet then, analyze the distribution of categories within STN

In the last part of this post, I mentioned certain points that can be improved to take this analyzes into an higher level.

# Network Construction

# Natural Language Processing Analysis

## Topic Determination

## Label prediction

### Text Generation to Test the Prediction Model

## Network Graph Analysis
