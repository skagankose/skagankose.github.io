# Introduction

Social media usage is significantly increased in recent years. According to [Smart Insights](http://www.smartinsights.com/social-media-marketing/social-media-strategy/new-global-social-media-research/), 482 million people joined social networks since the last year. There is an enormous amount of data created by these individuals. And, this data provides an unique opportunity to analyze societies.

Within the field of Natural Language Processing, there are highly effective techniques to extract meaningful informations from the pile of data. There are terrific sources to learn more about NLP.

I want to mention that deep learning has become a crucial part of NLP studies, especially after the paper [Natural Language Processing (almost) from Scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0398). Consequently, deep learning is (almost) a pre-requisite for studying NLP. Here are some of the outstanding courses about deep learning.

After writing up an extensive introduction, now, I proceed to details of my research.

Mainyl e analyzed the Twitter network of Istanbul Sehir Univesity using various NLP methods. More specifically, we tried to determine what are the most popular topics within the network. We analyze individuals and tried to determine what are they tweeting about. Furthermore, we study different different regions and individuals within the Sehir University network.
The organization of the rest of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we explained the methods that we used throughout the paper, Next, we present and interpret our results. In part 4, we conclude and restated important findings. Then, we mentioned couple of future work that we believe can take this study to a higher level.
